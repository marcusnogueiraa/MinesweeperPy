## **Description**
    This repository is a copy of the game "Minesweeper" made in the Python language. To create a graphical interface I used the PySide6 library, which uses the Qt 6.0 framework written in C++. The game architecture is divided into two layers, an interface that interacts with the user and is responsible for the operations carried out on the field.
